## New Ideas

#### Become the plant

Take a picture of the plant and be able to tell what kind of plant it is.

Asks for a user's zip code to find local UV information to formulate the best conditions and feeding regiment for said plant. Also notifies the user about when they should water the plant and do other things regarding cultivating a healthy plant.

#### Lunch Picker

An application in which we grab data online based on time of day and wanting of food. The user should be able to choose between price range and distance that they want to go. The user can then add or remove any restaurants they definitely do not want to go to. The app will then choose where you or the party should go.
